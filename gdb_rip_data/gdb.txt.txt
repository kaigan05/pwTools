gdb is open source program and very helpfull for debug the binary files from server files (gdelivery, gamedb the most important ones)

installation on linux (i use at moment debian based distro)

sudo apt-get install gdb

then how to get protocol number?

1. gdb ./gdelivery    - open binary file
2. ptype ProtocolType - all protocol
3. ptype GetMail      - GetMail is camel cased protocol name from previous list

so we got the protocol id (4204 = 0x106c) and we get the structure for request like int, localsid, unsigned char (byte)
